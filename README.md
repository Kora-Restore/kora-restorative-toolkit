# Kōra: A Living Toolkit for Restorative Civilizations

Kōra is an open-source, intercultural framework for reimagining justice, leadership, and social repair — rooted in the most peaceful, resilient, and sustainable societies in human history.

This is not a utopia. It is a blueprint grounded in ancient truth, real data, and modern clarity — offered freely to any community, school, nation, or system seeking to move beyond punishment, domination, and fear.

## 📊 Peace & Wellbeing Dashboard (Causal Forecast)

This dashboard models the evolution of peace and wellbeing across history using **causal variables**, not assumptions.  
It compares two possible futures:

- 🔻 **Projected Trend**: Continuation of current global governance, inequality, and military systems.
- 🌱 **Kōra Vision**: A restorative alternative, reducing violence and increasing shared wellbeing.
