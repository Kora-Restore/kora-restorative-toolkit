# 🧭 Electing Elders & Moderators

Kōra does not appoint rulers. It **recognizes stewards**.  
These guides hold space, offer wisdom, and mediate conflict — not through power, but through trust.

## 🌿 Principles for Recognition

| Value                 | Practice                                              |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Wisdom, not ambition   | Elders do not campaign. They are quietly recognized.  |
| Reputation, not title  | Selection is based on stories, not status.            |
| Humility, not authority| Elders serve. They do not command.                   |

## 👣 Selection Process

### 1. **Community Nomination**
- Individuals are nominated **by others**, not themselves.
- Criteria: Deep listening, moral clarity, compassion, intergenerational trust.

### 2. **Open Vetting Circles**
- Held publicly with **storytelling, praise, critique, and support**.
- The person listens in silence — the community speaks.

### 3. **Consensus or Supermajority Recognition**
- Through direct consensus, or a **representative council’s approval (75%+)**.
- Renewal every 3–6 years. Can be revoked by community request and review.

## 🧘 Removal or Resting

- Any elder may step down or request to “go silent” for a period.
- If trust is broken, a **restorative review process** is held.
- No shame — only return to balance.

## 📜 Cultural Note

Elder systems vary:
- Iroquois used **clan mothers** to recognize peace chiefs.
- African tribes used **councils of elders**, selected by behavior not wealth.
- Buddhist monastics used **consensus and silence** to elect abbots.

Kōra honors them all — and welcomes your way too.
