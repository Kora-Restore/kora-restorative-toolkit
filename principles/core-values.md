# 🌱 Core Values of Kōra

The foundation of all Kōra practice is **relationship**.  
These values are not abstract — they are lived, practiced, and built into how we resolve harm, elect leaders, and hold communities together.

## 🌀 1. **Whakapapa** — Interconnection

> "You are part of me. Your wound is mine to tend."

Derived from Māori culture, this principle teaches that **all beings are connected** through genealogy, place, and spirit.  
Conflict is not about broken rules — it is about broken **relationships**.

## ⚖️ 2. **Utu** — Restorative Balance

> "What has been thrown out of balance must be gently returned to center."

Utu is not revenge — it is **reciprocal restoration**. Instead of punishment, we return what was lost: trust, safety, dignity.

## 🫱 3. **Manaakitanga** — Compassion & Mutual Care

> "Justice must leave everyone more whole than before."

This is the **ethic of care** — the refusal to cast anyone out. Even those who cause harm are seen as **wounded participants** in a wider disconnection. They are not excluded — they are reintegrated.

## 🗣 4. **Kōrero** — Dialogue Over Accusation

> "Truth is not declared. It is revealed through careful listening."

Truth is found in **circle-based dialogue**, not courtroom combat. Everyone speaks. Everyone listens. Justice begins when all stories are told.

---

## 🧭 5. **Aroha** — Love Rooted in Courage

> "Peace is not passive. It is the bold act of holding space for healing."

Aroha is love in action — the **bravery to face harm with compassion**, not control. It is the spiritual engine of the restorative process.
