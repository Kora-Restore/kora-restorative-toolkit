# 🪞 When the Data Hurts: Why These Results Feel Wrong (And Why That Matters)

If you're reading this, chances are the results of the Kōra Peace & Wellbeing Index (PWI) surprised or unsettled you.  
You're not alone.

Seeing civilizations like Rome — long held as the height of achievement — score low, while Indigenous or "primitive" societies rank high, might feel backwards.  
But maybe that's not a flaw in the data. Maybe it's an invitation.

## 🤯 Why Do These Results *Feel* Wrong?

### 1. Because they challenge our programming.

We’ve been raised in systems that teach us:
- Rome = civilization  
- Modernity = success  
- Technology = progress  
- Power = prestige

Seeing “uncivilized” cultures score higher on peace and wellbeing feels upside down — but it might just mean we've been taught to look the wrong way.

### 2. Because we confuse “scale” with “good.”

Big empires look impressive. But this index rewards something else:
- How many people lived *well*?
- How many *died* to build it?
- How sustainable was it?
- Did the system rely on war, slavery, or conquest to function?

---

### 3. Because pain hides under neutrality.

The systems we live in today — capitalism, hierarchy, war economies — are so normalized we forget they’re *choices*, not inevitabilities.

So we judge ancient systems as “less evolved,” even if they caused less suffering.

## 🔬 Let’s Look at the Algorithm

We calculate:

- **Violence Index (VI)** = Conflicts × Deaths per conflict  
- **Sustainable & Equitable Wellbeing Index (SEWI)** = Avg of:
  - Basic Human Wellbeing (BHW)
  - Equality & Fairness (EF)
  - Ecological Sustainability (ES)  
- **Peace & Wellbeing Index (PWI)** = SEWI / VI

So any system that:
- Had frequent wars  
- Caused massive death  
- Exploited people or ecosystems  
→ Drops in score.

It's that simple. And that radical.

## 🧠 But Let’s Be Honest: Should We Refine It?

Yes. Always. We are open-source for a reason.

We must continually ask:
- Are the inputs fair?
- Are the deaths properly measured?
- Should violence be weighted logarithmically?
- Should wellbeing include joy, mental health, or artistic expression?
- Should PWI reflect population served?

## 🧘 This Isn't a Mistake. It's a Mirror.

The discomfort you feel is not a bug — it’s a sign this work matters.

This isn’t about glorifying the past.  
It’s about finally having the courage to ask:

> *What actually makes a society good?*  
> *And what if everything we were taught to admire... came at too high a cost?*

### You’re not wrong to feel what you’re feeling.  
Stay with it. That’s where the real learning begins.
